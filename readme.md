This is anlog clock made by using HTML, css & JS.
I learned in this project that - How to use "Box-shadow" to enhance above tectures like Glass

Css for that :
{

box-shadow: 0 -15px 15px rgba(255,255,255,0.05),

inset 0 -15px 15px rgba(255,255,255,0.05),

0 15px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.3),

inset 0 15px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);

}

Also I learned that - how to add img from G-drive to Background by using :

1. In URL : " http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ONA6i6S6HYQtWCIFYrgvqUNw0lzor18_ "

2.This is commn part for all : " http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view& "

after above part you only add id of G-drive img, in my case ID is " id=1ONA6i6S6HYQtWCIFYrgvqUNw0lzor18\_ "

Css for that :
{
background: url(http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ONA6i6S6HYQtWCIFYrgvqUNw0lzor18_);
}
